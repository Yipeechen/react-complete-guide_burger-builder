# 154. Creating a Layout Component

* containers: are stateful components, which created with the class keyword or functional component using useState and components going into the components folder are dumb or presentational components that don't manage state

* assets: use this later once we add a logo

* hoc: for higher order component e.g. Aux component
  - Aux: auxiliary component
    - it's a functional component where I also won't manage any state with hooks
    - don't even have any JSX in this file
